This is the case for 2D fluid mud expriment in tidal inlet system, with the coupling of 3D sediment transport model.

1. This model is online driven by current and sediment.

2. The sediment model is original CSTM sediment module (ORIG_SED flag in make.inc).

3. The parameters for fluid mud are specified in offline_oneway_sediment.inp.

4. It should be noted that the time step for 2D fluid mud could be specified in offline_oneway_sediment.inp (DTE_RATIO), which uausally configured as 1/DTE_RATIO*DTE.

5. The thickness and motion velocities of fluid mud has been archived in default  output netcdf file.
